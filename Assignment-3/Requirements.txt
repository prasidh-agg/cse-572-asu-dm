Python Library Requirements: 
- pandas 
- numpy 
- scikit-learn 
- tabulate
- run 'pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tabulate'

Steps to run the code: 
1. Enter the paths to the CGMdata and InsulinData.csv files
2. Run the main.py file (keep the auxillary files data_extraction.py, feature_extraction.py, metrics.py in the same directory as that of main.py file)
3. It will compute all the needed metrics and save it in Results.csv 

Notes:
- Have run the project mainly on python 3.8.15. 
- Have tested it on python 3.10.6 and python 3.9.12 as well without running into any issues.
